# Installation Instructions
1. Extract V1.1.zip and copy the contents into (Icarus-Root)/Icarus/Binaries/Win64;
2. Then, in that same folder, create a folder and call it "mods", this is where you'll put .dll mods (Not xinput.dll or daedalus.dll).

# Where To Find Mods
Keep in mind, for now the only mods you'll be able to use are mods found here.
  * [My Mods](https://github.com/R3ap3r0fS0uls/Daedalus-Mods)

# Notes
* The mod loader is not currently supported in dx12, so when starting Icarus, select dx11.

# Daedalus
A modloader for [Icarus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/) for blueprint and
C++ based mods. Still heavily under construction, see below for proper accredidation and info.

# Credit
This project was originally a fork of an old version of 
[SatisfactoryModLoader](https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader) but has since
transitioned to using a fork of [UnrealModLoader](https://github.com/RussellJerome/UnrealModLoader).

Most credit should go to [RusselJerome](https://github.com/RussellJerome) for his UnrealModLoader project
(seriously awesome software), and the amazing reverse engineers behind [UnrealDumper](https://github.com/guttir14/UnrealDumper-4.25)
who have made profiles for which I've pulled offsets.
